# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-18)

**Core value:** A player completes one Beer Game round in one sitting and *sees* the bullwhip effect emerge in the post-game debrief — charts and narrative make the lesson land without an instructor in the room.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Simulation Engine + AI

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Simulation Engine + AI)
Plan: 2 of 3 complete in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-05-18 — Completed Plan 01-02 (Sterman empirical agent + ENG-01 AST-walk streamlit-import guard; 33/33 tests pass)

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 17%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 3.5min
- Total execution time: 7min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Simulation Engine + AI | 2/3 | 7min | 3.5min |
| 2. UI Shell + Per-Turn Play | 0/TBD | — | — |
| 3. Debrief Charts + Narrative | 0/TBD | — | — |
| 4. Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud | 0/TBD | — | — |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (5min, 2 tasks, 19 files), 01-02 (2min, 2 tasks, 4 files)
- Trend: accelerating (smaller surface, all auto-fixes avoided)

*Updated after each plan completion*

| Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|------|----------|-------|-------|
| Phase 01-simulation-engine-ai P01 | 5min | 2 tasks | 19 files |
| Phase 01-simulation-engine-ai P02 | 2min | 2 tasks | 4 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 1]: Engine is pure-Python — zero `streamlit` imports — so pytest can verify the canonical bullwhip headlessly before any UI work.
- [Phase 1]: Sterman *empirical* parameters (α≈0.26, β≈0.34, θ≈0.36, S′≈17), not JASSS 2014 "optimal" values — empirical produces the lesson, optimal silently kills it.
- [Phase 1]: Two pytest gates exit Phase 1 — equilibrium regression and bullwhip calibration (ratio ∈ [2.0, 4.0]). No UI work begins until both pass.
- [Phase 4]: Deploy uses `requirements.txt` only — `uv.lock` is NOT committed (Streamlit Cloud's dependency-file priority would pick it up; yanked transitives can wedge builds).
- [Phase 01-simulation-engine-ai]: ORDER_PIPELINE_LEN_FACTORY = 1 (NOT 0); Factory inbound order channel uses canonical 1-week mailing delay (BLOCKER 1 fix verified — Factory inventory stays at 12, not 16, under equilibrium)
- [Phase 01-simulation-engine-ai]: Transient intra-tick fields on StationState (compare=False, repr=False) carry data between named tick steps; zeroed in step 3 and step 5
- [Phase 01-simulation-engine-ai]: Agent Protocol imports StationView under TYPE_CHECKING to break engine.tick <-> ai.base circular import; runtime isinstance check still works via runtime_checkable
- [Phase 01-simulation-engine-ai]: S' (desired_inventory) locked at 17.0 in beergame/ai/sterman.py per Sterman 1989 median. If Plan 03 GATE 2 misses [2.0, 4.0], tune S' here — NEVER widen the test bounds.
- [Phase 01-simulation-engine-ai]: ShipmentAnchorAndAdjustAgent is a mutable @dataclass (not frozen) because decide_order updates self.smoothed_demand each week; per-agent forecast state kept on the agent, not threaded through StationView.
- [Phase 01-simulation-engine-ai]: ENG-01 enforced structurally via AST-walk pytest test (not grep) — catches `import streamlit` and `from streamlit.* import ...` cleanly, prints file:line on failure, sabotage-verified.
