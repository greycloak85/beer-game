# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-18)

**Core value:** A player completes one Beer Game round in one sitting and *sees* the bullwhip effect emerge in the post-game debrief — charts and narrative make the lesson land without an instructor in the room.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Simulation Engine + AI

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Simulation Engine + AI)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-05-18 — Roadmap created (4 phases, 33/33 v1 requirements mapped)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 1]: Engine is pure-Python — zero `streamlit` imports — so pytest can verify the canonical bullwhip headlessly before any UI work.
- [Phase 1]: Sterman *empirical* parameters (α≈0.26, β≈0.34, θ≈0.36, S′≈17), not JASSS 2014 "optimal" values — empirical produces the lesson, optimal silently kills it.
- [Phase 1]: Two pytest gates exit Phase 1 — equilibrium regression and bullwhip calibration (ratio ∈ [2.0, 4.0]). No UI work begins until both pass.
- [Phase 4]: Deploy uses `requirements.txt` only — `uv.lock` is NOT committed (Streamlit Cloud's dependency-file priority would pick it up; yanked transitives can wedge builds).
